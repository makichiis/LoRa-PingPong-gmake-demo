# LoRa-PingPong-gmake-demo

## Building
GNU Make -- as well as whatever embedded ARM compiler preferred for your
system -- is **REQUIRED** to build this project.

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the stm32-for-vscode extension
to build and flash this project, unless you know what you're doing (lord knows
I dont).

## Configuration
If changing the parameters/conditions for your STM32WL5x dev board, STM32CubeMX is
highly recommended as this project uses STM32Cube boilerplate.
